Machine learning is a complex subject area. Goal is to introduce you to some of the most common terms and ideas used in machine learning. 
We will then walk you through the different steps involved in machine learning and finish with a series of examples that use machine learning to solve real-world situations.

Machine learning (ML) is a modern software development technique, and a type of artificial intelligence (AI), 
that enables computers to solve problems by using examples of real-world data. 
It allows computers to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed to do so.

THREE KEY PARTS:
Machine learning is part of the broader field of artificial intelligence. 
This field is concerned with the capability of machines to perform activities using human-like intelligence. 
Within machine learning there are several different kinds of tasks or techniques:

In supervised learning, every training sample from the dataset has a corresponding label or output value associated with it.
As a result, the algorithm learns to predict labels or output values. We will explore this in-depth in this lesson.
In unsupervised learning, there are no labels for the training data. A machine learning algorithm tries to learn the underlying patterns or distributions that govern the data. 
We will explore this in-depth in this lesson.
In reinforcement learning, the algorithm figures out which actions to take in a situation to maximize a reward (in the form of a number) on the way to reaching a specific goal. 
This is a completely different approach than supervised and unsupervised learning.

How is machine learning different?
In traditional problem-solving with software, a person analyzes a problem and engineers a solution in code to solve that problem. 
For many real-world problems, this process can be laborious (or even impossible) because a correct solution would need to take a vast number of edge cases into consideration.
