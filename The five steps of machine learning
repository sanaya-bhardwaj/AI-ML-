Major steps in the machine learning process
Step 1 : Define the problem
Step 2: Build the Dataset
Step 3: Train the Model 
Step 4: Evaluate the model 
Step 5: Use the Model 


DEFINE THE PROBLEM 
How do you start a machine learning task?
To get started, it is important to follow these two important steps

Step 1: Define a very specific task
Think back to the snow cone sales example. Now imagine that you own a frozen treats store and you sell snow cones along with many other products. You wonder, "How do I increase sales?" It's a valid question, but it's the opposite of a very specific task. The following examples demonstrate how a machine learning practitioner might attempt to answer that question.

Question: Does adding a $1.00 charge for sprinkles on a hot fudge sundae increase the sales of hot fudge sundaes?
Question: Does adding a $0.50 charge for organic flavors in your snow cone increase the sales of snow cones?
Step 2: Identify the machine learning task we might use to solve this problem

This helps you better understand the data you need for a project.
What exactly is a machine learning task?
All model training algorithms, and the models themselves, take data as their input. Their outputs can be very different and are classified into a few different groups, based on the task they are designed to solve.
Often, we use the kind of data required to train a model as part of defining a machine learning task.
In this lesson, we will focus on two common machine learning tasks:

Supervised learning
Unsupervised learning




Clustering is an unsupervised learning task that helps to determine if there are any naturally occurring groupings in the data.
A categorical label has a discrete set of possible values, such as "is a cat" and "is not a cat."
A continuous (regression) label does not have a discrete set of possible values, which means there are potentially an unlimited number of possibilities.
Discrete is a term taken from statistics referring to an outcome that takes only a finite number of values (such as days of the week).
A label refers to data that already contains the solution.
Using unlabeled data means you don't need to provide the model with any kind of label or solution while the model is being trained.
